# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-sent` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- `SentMessage::message()` now sends as a plain-text message when no template is set, via the SDK's new `text` param. Template still takes priority when both are set.

### Fixed

- The scheduled SDK-drift audit (`spec_drift.py`) no longer crashes on `FileNotFoundError` — it now creates the `openapi/` directory before writing findings.

### Changed

- Bumped `sentdm/sent-dm-php` from `^0.23` to `^0.26`.
